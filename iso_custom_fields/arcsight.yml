        The behavior category of the event

        Events not only refer to certain objects, 
        but there is generally an action or a behavior associated with an event. 
        What is being done to an object? Behaviors include access, execution, 
        or modification, and so on

    - name: category.device.group
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Event's device group
      description: >
        The device group of the event.

        Many devices serve a multitude of purposes in one product. 
        Intrusion Prevention Systems, for example, generate events 
        associated with their firewall capabilities, 
        as well as their intrusion detection capabilities. 
        Routers can generate events associated with user authentication, etc. 
        To distinguish between these types of events, 
        we introduced a dimension called deviceGroup. 
        This dimension lets us query, for example, 
        all the firewall-type events as opposed to all the events generated by a firewall. 
        The distinction is that the former query also returns all the firewall messages in, 
        for example, the operating system logs (such as iptables). 
        Or, in the case of an intrusion prevention system, it has two types of events. 
        One type about firewall-type events (for example, blocking and passing traffic) 
        and the other type being intrusion detection style messages 
        (for example, detection of malicious behavior). 
        The former type would contain the value 'Firewall' in the deviceGroup 
        and the latter would be 'IDS.'

    - name: category.device.type
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Event's device type
      description: >
        The device type of the event.

        This dimension lets us query for all types of events generated by a certain device type, 
        no matter what device group the events belong to. 
        For example, the events of the Device Type "firewall" 
        are all the events generated by the Firewalls (Checkpoint, Cisco PIX, Netscreen, etc) 
        no matter if those events are about blocking traffic 
        or adding new users or restarting the device.
  
    - name: category.object
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Event's object category
      description: >
        The event's Arcsight object cateogory

        Events are always about a certain object. An object can, for example, 
        be an application, the operating system, a database, a file, or the memory of a server. 
        It is important to realize that we are referring to the targeted object 
        or the focus of the event. It is not about who is doing something, 
        but what is the object being accessed, altered, etc. or what is the focus of the event.
    
    - name: category.outcome
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Event's outcome
      description: >
        The event's Arcsight outcome

        With the first two dimensions, we know what object is being referred to 
        and what action targeted the object. 
        However, we do not know whether the behavior was successful or not. 
        Therefore, the outcome is a success, a failure, or an attempt. 
        An attempt really indicates that something was neither a success nor a failure 
        and the outcome is not clear or there is no statement that could be made about the outcome.

    - name: category.significance
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Event's significance
      description: >
        The event's Arcsight significance

        We need the capability to separate normal events from hostile events. 
        We also need to know whether certain activity reported by the device 
        impacts the availability, confidentiality, or integrity of our systems. 
        All this information is captured in the significance.

        Significance expresses the broad characterization of events from a device's perspective. 
        This determination is built into ArcSight's categorization efforts.

    - name: category.technique
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Event's technique
      description: >
        The event's Arcsight technique

        Frequently, in a security context, 
        we would like to get information about the type of events with respect to a security domain. 
        Is an event talking about a denial of service, a brute force attack, IDS evasions, 
        exploits of vulnerabilities, and so on.
